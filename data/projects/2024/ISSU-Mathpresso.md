### Design the `'Final version of Study Note'`
- Conducted user research (survey, n=117) and an in-depth interview, identifying that the AI-generated summaries fail to adapt to individual learning goals and study styles.
- Designed a goal-driven workflow which allows users to specify learning objectives and customize AI output parameters before generation.
- Devised a human-in-the-loop editing interaction enabling partial masking and iterative co-creation.
